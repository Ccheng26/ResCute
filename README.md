The Approach Taken
------
We began with our general API research relative to our project idea. After [wireframing](https://imgur.com/a/UEqA0) and mapping out our [entity relationship diagrams](https://imgur.com/a/QTyLS), we played to our strong suits and completed role assignments. Working under an agile development system, we completed our backend database, route directives and front-end objectives. As an additional feature, we added a media page for instructional videos. Lastly we've deployed our site, which you can find if you [click here](http://infinite-mesa-86574.herokuapp.com/).

Unsolved Problems
------
There were some issues retrieving live data which slowed down our servers. In the future, we are looking into adding a social media aspect to our page to share pet recommendations with friends and family members.
